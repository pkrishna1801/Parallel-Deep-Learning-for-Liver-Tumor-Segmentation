# Parallel-Deep-Learning-for-Liver-Tumor-Segmentation-
The primary motivation for this project stems from the need to improve the efficiency of liver segmentation. While UNet provides high segmentation accuracy, training times can be prohibitively long, particularly for large medical imaging datasets. This challenge necessitates exploring parallel training methods.
